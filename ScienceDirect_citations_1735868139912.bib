abstract = {Purpose
Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot utilize insulin properly. Maintenance of the levels of insulin in the body is mandatory, otherwise it will lead to several disorders of kidney failure, heart attack, nervous weakness, blindness, etc. Among the 10 majority diseases, diabetes is occupying the second role by covering 34.2 million individuals as for the National Diabetes Statistics report. According to the World Health Organization, diabetes is playing the 7th role in cause of death. Thus early identification of diabetes can overcome these severe damages.
Methods
Accurate predictions require a lot of data, which is introducing the curse of dimensionality. In the present research, PIMA Indians diabetes data set is considered and different classification models viz., K-means clustering with logistic regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Random Forest, etc. are implemented in predicting the accuracy of diabetes.
Results
The accuracies for diabetes prediction are ranging from 0.9875 to 1.0. KCPM (K-means cluster prediction model) and has shown an increase in accuracy of 0.67% for the combined K -means clustering and different classification algorithms. In KCPM, firstly, the data is clustered using k-means into patients with and without diabetes, and then the clustered results are compared with the target variable and then filtered, followed by applying the different supervised classification algorithms for predicting the disease.
Conclusion
The results show that KCPM predicts diabetes with a higher accuracy of 0.67% compared with other existing methods. By KCPM-based automated diabetes analysis system, early prediction of the disease may protect patients from facing severe disorders in life.}

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in oncology, particularly for biomedical applications such as drug discovery, drug repurposing, diagnostics, clinical trial design, and pharmaceutical production. MLAs have the potential to provide valuable insights and predictions in these areas by representing both the disease state and the therapeutic agents used to treat it. To fully utilize the capabilities of MLAs in oncology, it is important to understand the fundamental concepts underlying these algorithms and how they can be applied to assess the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutics.

Over the last years, there have been advances in the use of data-driven techniques to improve the definition, early recognition, subtypes characterisation, prognostication and treatment personalisation of sepsis. Some of those involve the discovery or evaluation of biomarkers or digital signatures of sepsis or sepsis sub-phenotypes. It is hoped that their identification may improve timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, suggest physiological pathways and therapeutic targets, inform targeted recruitment into clinical trials, and optimise clinical management. Given the complexities of the sepsis response, panels of biomarkers or models combining biomarkers and clinical data are necessary, as well as specific data analysis methods, which broadly fall under the scope of machine learning. This narrative review gives a brief overview of the main machine learning techniques (mainly in the realms of supervised and unsupervised methods) and published applications that have been used to create sepsis diagnostic tools and identify biomarkers.}

Breast cancer disease is the most common cancer in US women and the second cause of cancer death among women.
Objectives
To compare and evaluate the performance and accuracy of the key supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms for breast cancer prediction.
Materials and methods
We have used nine machine learning classification algorithms for supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL): 1) Logistic regression; 2) Gaussian Naive Bayes; 3) Linear Support vector machine; 4) RBF Support vector machine; 5) Decision Tree; 6) Random Forest; 7) Xgboost; 8) Gradient Boosting; 9) KNN. The Wisconsin Diagnosis Cancer dataset was used to train and test these models. To ensure the robustness of the model, we have applied K-fold cross-validation and optimized hyperparameters. We have evaluated and compared the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
Results
The results of all models are inspiring using both SL and SSL. The SSL has high accuracy (90%–98%) with just half of the training data. The KNN model for the SL and logistic regression for the SSL achieved the highest accuracy of 98%
Conclusion
The accuracies of SSL algorithms are very close to the SL algorithms. The accuracies of all models are in the range of 91–98%. SSL is a promising and competitive approach to solve the problem. Using a small sample of labeled and low computational power, the SSL is fully capable of replacing SL algorithms in diagnosing tumor type.}

abstract = {Although several cell-based therapies have received FDA approval, and others are showing promising results, scalable, and quality-driven reproducible manufacturing of therapeutic cells at a lower cost remains challenging. Challenges include starting material and patient variability, limited understanding of manufacturing process parameter effects on quality, complex supply chain logistics, and lack of predictive, well-understood product quality attributes. These issues can manifest as increased production costs, longer production times, greater batch-to-batch variability, and lower overall yield of viable, high-quality cells. The lack of data-driven insights and decision-making in cell manufacturing and delivery is an underlying commonality behind all these problems. Data collection and analytics from discovery, preclinical and clinical research, process development, and product manufacturing have not been sufficiently utilized to develop a "systems" understanding and identify actionable controls. Experience from other industries shows that data science and analytics can drive technological innovations and manufacturing optimization, leading to improved consistency, reduced risk, and lower cost. The cell therapy manufacturing industry will benefit from implementing data science tools, such as data-driven modeling, data management and mining, AI, and machine learning. The integration of data-driven predictive capabilities into cell therapy manufacturing, such as predicting product quality and clinical outcomes based on manufacturing data, or ensuring robustness and reliability using data-driven supply-chain modeling could enable more precise and efficient production processes and lead to better patient access and outcomes. In this review, we introduce some of the relevant computational and data science tools and how they are being or can be implemented in the cell therapy manufacturing workflow. We also identify areas where innovative approaches are required to address challenges and opportunities specific to the cell therapy industry. We conclude that interfacing data science throughout a cell therapy product lifecycle, developing data-driven manufacturing workflow, designing better data collection tools and algorithms, using data analytics and AI-based methods to better understand critical quality attributes and critical-process parameters, and training the appropriate workforce will be critical for overcoming current industry and regulatory barriers and accelerating clinical translation.}

abstract = {Purpose
To explore the characteristics of the clinical phenotype of ARDS based on Machine Learning.
Methods
This is a study on Machine Learning. Screened cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the eICU database collected basic information in the cases and clinical data on the Day 1, Day 3, and Day 7 after the diagnosis of ARDS, respectively. Using the Calinski-Harabasz criterion, Gap Statistic, and Silhouette Coefficient, we determine the optimal clustering number k value. By the K-means cluster analysis to derive clinical phenotype, we analyzed the data collected within the first 24 h. We compared it with the survival of cases under the Berlin standard classification, and also examined the phenotypic conversion within the first 24 h, on day 3, and on day 7 after the diagnosis of ARDS.
Results
We collected 5054 cases and derived three clinical phenotypes using K-means cluster analysis. Phenotype-I is characterized by fewer abnormal laboratory indicators, higher oxygen partial pressure, oxygenation index, APACHE IV score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and lower respiratory rate and heart rate. Phenotype-II is characterized by elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose, creatinine, temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Phenotype-III is characterized by elevated age, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, GCS score, albumin. The differences in ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality were significantly different between the three phenotypes (P < 0.05), with phenotype I having the lowest in-hospital mortality (10 %) and phenotype II having the highest (31.8 %). To compare the survival analysis of ARDS patients classified by phenotype and those classified according to Berlin criteria. The results showed that the differences in survival between phenotypes were statistically significant (P < 0.05) under phenotypic classification.
Conclusions
The clinical classification of ARDS based on K-means clustering analysis is beneficial for further identifying ARDS patients with different characteristics. Compared to the Berlin standard, the new clinical classification of ARDS provides a clearer display of the survival status of different types of patients, which helps to predict patient prognosis.}

abstract = {Objectives
Patient representation learning refers to learning a dense mathematical representation of a patient that encodes meaningful information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is generally performed using advanced deep learning methods. This study presents a systematic review of this field and provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses from a methodological perspective.
Methods
We identified studies developing patient representations from EHRs with deep learning methods from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library. After screening 363 articles, 49 papers were included for a comprehensive data collection.
Results
Publications developing patient representations almost doubled each year from 2015 until 2019. We noticed a typical workflow starting with feeding raw data, applying deep learning models, and ending with clinical outcome predictions as evaluations of the learned representations. Specifically, learning representations from structured EHR data was dominant (37 out of 49 studies). Recurrent Neural Networks were widely applied as the deep learning architecture (Long short-term memory: 13 studies, Gated recurrent unit: 11 studies). Learning was mainly performed in a supervised manner (30 studies) optimized with cross-entropy loss. Disease prediction was the most common application and evaluation (31 studies). Benchmark datasets were mostly unavailable (28 studies) due to privacy concerns of EHR data, and code availability was assured in 20 studies.
Discussion & Conclusion
The existing predictive models mainly focus on the prediction of single diseases, rather than considering the complex mechanisms of patients from a holistic review. We show the importance and feasibility of learning comprehensive representations of patient EHR data through a systematic review. Advances in patient representation learning techniques will be essential for powering patient-level EHR analyses. Future work will still be devoted to leveraging the richness and potential of available EHR data. Reproducibility and transparency of reported results will hopefully improve. Knowledge distillation and advanced learning techniques will be exploited to assist the capability of learning patient representation further.}

EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.}

abstract = {Background
The electronic health record (EHR) contains a wealth of medical information. An organized EHR can greatly help doctors treat patients. In some cases, only limited patient information is collected to help doctors make treatment decisions. Because EHRs can serve as a reference for this limited information, doctors’ treatment capabilities can be enhanced. Natural language processing and deep learning methods can help organize and translate EHR information into medical knowledge and experience.
Objective
In this study, we aimed to create a model to extract concept embeddings from EHRs for disease pattern retrieval and further classification tasks.
Methods
We collected 1,040,989 emergency department visits from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database and 305,897 samples from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department data. After data cleansing and preprocessing, the data sets were divided into training, validation, and test sets. We proposed a Transformer-based model to embed EHRs and used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract features from free text and concatenate features with structural data as input to our proposed model. Then, Deep InfoMax (DIM) and Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) were used for the unsupervised embedding of the disease concept. The pretrained disease concept-embedding model, named EDisease, was further finetuned to adapt to the critical care outcome prediction task. We evaluated the performance of embedding using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to perform dimension reduction for visualization. The performance of the finetuned predictive model was evaluated against published models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC).
Results
The performance of our model on the outcome prediction had the highest AUROC of 0.876. In the ablation study, the use of a smaller data set or fewer unsupervised methods for pretraining deteriorated the prediction performance. The AUROCs were 0.857, 0.870, and 0.868 for the model without pretraining, the model pretrained by only SimCLR, and the model pretrained by only DIM, respectively. On the smaller finetuning set, the AUROC was 0.815 for the proposed model.
Conclusions
Through contrastive learning methods, disease concepts can be embedded meaningfully. Moreover, these methods can be used for disease retrieval tasks to enhance clinical practice capabilities. The disease concept model is also suitable as a pretrained model for subsequent prediction tasks.}

The analysis performed here indicates several clusters of infection prevalence varying between 2%–37%, showing that our procedure is indeed capable of finding different patterns. A possible explanation is that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory infection but a systemic disease with critical hematological implications, primarily on white-cell fractions, as indicated by relevant statistical test p-values in the range of 0.03–0.1. The novel analysis procedure proposed could be adopted in other data-sets of different illnesses to help researchers to discover new patterns of data that could be used in various diseases and contexts.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is getting a foothold in medicine for disease screening and diagnosis. While typical machine learning methods require large labeled datasets for training and validation, their application is limited in clinical fields since ground truth information can hardly be obtained on a sizeable cohort of patients. Unsupervised neural networks – such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) – represent an alternative approach to identifying hidden patterns in biomedical data. Here we investigate the feasibility of SOMs for the identification of malignant and non-malignant regions in liquid biopsies of thyroid nodules, on a patient-specific basis. MALDI-ToF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight) mass spectrometry-imaging (MSI) was used to measure the spectral profile of bioptic samples. SOMs were then applied for the analysis of MALDI-MSI data of individual patients’ samples, also testing various pre-processing and agglomerative clustering methods to investigate their impact on SOMs’ discrimination efficacy. The final clustering was compared against the sample’s probability to be malignant, hyperplastic or related to Hashimoto thyroiditis as quantified by multinomial regression with LASSO. Our results show that SOMs are effective in separating the areas of a sample containing benign cells from those containing malignant cells. Moreover, they allow to overlap the different areas of cytological glass slides with the corresponding proteomic profile image, and inspect the specific weight of every cellular component in bioptic samples. We envision that this approach could represent an effective means to assist pathologists in diagnostic tasks, avoiding the need to manually annotate cytological images and the effort in creating labeled datasets.}

abstract = {Skin lesions diagnostic is a challenging problem due to the variety of visual aspects of the lesions. The clinical analysis of skin lesions relies on the visual information as well as on the complementary information provided by the patient. Since dermatologists make use of visual cues and patient clinical information, we investigate if the combination of features from convolutional neural networks (CNN), handcrafted features and patient clinical information can improve the performance of automated diagnosis of skin cancer. Most works on skin lesion diagnosis in the literature use dermoscopic images without patient clinical information. In order to address this problem, we used a clinical image dataset of skin lesions with patient information collected via smartphone named PAD-UFES-20. With the proposed fusion architecture we show that the results using clinical features as a complement to the CNN and handcrafted features improve the classification in terms of balanced accuracy by 7.1 % for cancer and by 3.2 % for melanoma as compared with only features extracted from a CNN. In addition, our findings show that combining only handcrafted features with deep features did not improve the results, indicating the importance of using clinical metadata for skin lesion classification.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aimed to stratify eyes with keratoconus (KC) based on longitudinal changes in all Pentacam parameters into clusters using unsupervised machine learning, with the broader objective of more clearly defining the characteristics of KC progression.
Methods
A data-driven cluster analysis (hierarchical clustering) was undertaken on a retrospective cohort of 1017 kC eyes and 128 control eyes. Clusters were derived using 6-month tomographical change in individual eyes from analysis of the reduced dimensionality parameter space using all available Pentacam parameters (406 principal components). The optimal number of clusters was determined by the clustering's capacity to discriminate progression between KC and control eyes based on change across parameters. One-way ANOVA was used to compare parameters between inferred clusters. Complete Pentacam data changes at 6, 12 and 18-month time points provided validation datasets to determine the generalizability of the clustering model.
Results
We identified three clusters in KC progression patterns. Eyes designated within cluster 3 had the most rapidly changing tomographical parameters compared to eyes in either cluster 1 or 2. Eyes designated within cluster 1 reflected minimal changes in tomographical parameters, closest to the tomographical changes of control (non-KC) eyes. Thirty-nine corneal curvature parameters were identified and associated with these stratified clusters, with each of these parameters changing significantly different between three clusters. Similar clusters were identified at the 6, 12 and 18-month follow-up.
Conclusions
The clustering model developed was able to automatically detect and categorize KC tomographical features into fast, slow, or limited change at different time points. This new KC stratification tool may provide an opportunity to provide a precision medicine approach to KC.}

abstract = {Precision and personalized medicine, the process by which patient management is tailored to individual circumstances, are now terms that are familiar to cardiologists, despite it still being an emerging field. Although precision medicine relies most often on the underlying biology and pathophysiology of a patient’s condition, personalized medicine relies on digital biomarkers generated through algorithms. Given the complexity of the underlying data, these digital biomarkers are most often generated through machine-learning algorithms. There are a number of analytic considerations regarding the creation of digital biomarkers that are discussed in this review, including data preprocessing, time dependency and gating, dimensionality reduction, and novel methods, both in the realm of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Some of these considerations, such as sample size requirements and measurements of model performance, are particularly challenging in small and heterogeneous populations with rare outcomes such as children with congenital heart disease. Finally, we review analytic considerations for the deployment of digital biomarkers in clinical settings, including the emerging field of clinical artificial intelligence (AI) operations, computational needs for deployment, efforts to increase the explainability of AI, algorithmic drift, and the needs for distributed surveillance and federated learning. We conclude this review by discussing a recent simulation study that shows that, despite these analytic challenges and complications, the use of digital biomarkers in managing clinical care might have substantial benefits regarding individual patient outcomes.
RÉsumÉ
La médecine de précision et la médecine personnalisée, qui consistent à adapter la prise en charge d’un patient à sa situation personnelle, sont des termes connus des cardiologues, même s’il s’agit d’un domaine encore émergent. La médecine de précision repose le plus souvent sur les paramètres biologiques et physiopathologiques qui sous-tendent l’état d’un patient, tandis que la médecine personnalisée utilise des biomarqueurs numériques générés au moyen d’algorithmes. Vu la complexité des données sous-jacentes, ces biomarqueurs numériques sont principalement générés au moyen d’algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique. Nous examinons ici divers facteurs analytiques pris en compte pour générer des biomarqueurs numériques, notamment le prétraitement des données, l’évolution et la fragmentation des données (« gating ») en fonction du temps, la réduction de dimensionnalité et les nouvelles méthodes, tant pour l’apprentissage automatique supervisé que non supervisé. Certains de ces facteurs, par exemple les exigences relatives à la taille de l’échantillon et les mesures de la performance du modèle, présentent des difficultés particulières pour les populations petites et hétérogènes de patients atteints de maladies rares, par exemple les enfants atteints de cardiopathie congénitale. Enfin, nous passons en revue les facteurs analytiques utilisés pour le déploiement de biomarqueurs numériques en contexte clinique, par exemple le domaine émergent des opérations cliniques d’intelligence artificielle (IA), les besoins informatiques liés au déploiement, les efforts nécessaires pour améliorer l’explicabilité de l’IA, la dérive algorithmique et les besoins liés aux systèmes distribués de surveillance et de l’apprentissage fédéré. Nous concluons en présentant une récente étude de simulation qui révèle qu’en dépit de ces difficultés et complications analytiques, l’utilisation de biomarqueurs numériques pour la prise en charge clinique promet d’améliorer de façon notable les résultats pour les patients.}

However, integrating AI into the clinical practice requires overcoming challenges such as data quality, the complexity of human pain physiology, and validation against diverse patient populations.

Clinical studies investigating the benefits of beta-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) among critically ill patients are hindered by small patient groups, variability between studies, patient heterogeneity, and inadequate use of TDM. Accordingly, definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of TDM remain elusive. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages data-driven methods to unveil the concealed connections between therapy effectiveness and patient data, collected through a randomized controlled trial (DRKS00011159; 10th October 2016). Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms can successfully identify informative features that distinguish between healthy and sick states. These hold promise as potential markers for disease classification and severity stratification, as well as offering a continuous and data-driven “multidimensional” Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The positive impact of TDM on patient recovery rates is demonstrated by unraveling the intricate connections between therapy effectiveness and clinically relevant data via machine learning.}

Our study is based on a comprehensive database comprising 668 volunteers from 5 different hospitals, collected over a decade. This diverse dataset enables better training and validation of our results. Among the methods evaluated, the CNN (deep learning) approach outperformed others, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 97.45% for patients with Moderate Alzheimer's Dementia (ADM) and 97.03% for patients with Advanced Alzheimer's Dementia (ADA). Importantly, all the compared methods were rigorously assessed under identical conditions. The proposed DL model, specifically CNN, effectively extracts time domain features from EEG data in time, resulting in a significant reduction in learnable parameters and data redundancy.}

abstract = {Background
Databases for Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are effective in delivering accessible datasets ready for statistical inference. Data collection hitherto has, however, been labour and time intensive and has required substantial financial support to ensure sustainability. We propose here creation and piloting of a semiautomated technique for data extraction from clinic letters to populate a clinical database.
Methods
PDF formatted clinic letters stored in a local folder, through a series of algorithms, underwent data extraction, preprocessing, and analysis. Specific patient information (diagnoses, diagnostic complexity, interventions, arrhythmia, medications, and demographic data) was processed into text files and structured data tables, used to populate a database. A specific data validation schema was predefined to verify and accommodate the information populating the database. Unsupervised learning in the form of a dimensionality reduction technique was used to project data into 2 dimensions and visualize their intrinsic structure in relation to the diagnosis, medication, intervention, and European Society of Cardiology classification lists of disease complexity. Ninety-three randomly selected letters were reviewed manually for accuracy.
Results
There were 1409 consecutive outpatient clinic letters used to populate the Scottish Adult Congenital Cardiac Database. Mean patient age was 35.4 years; 47.6% female; with 698 (49.5%) having moderately complex, 369 (26.1%) greatly complex, and 284 (20.1%) mildly complex lesions. Individual diagnoses were successfully extracted in 96.95%, and demographic data were extracted in 100% of letters. Data extraction, database upload, data analysis and visualization took 571 seconds (9.51 minutes). Manual data extraction in the categories of diagnoses, intervention, and medications yielded accuracy of the computer algorithm in 94%, 93%, and 93%, respectively.
Conclusions
Semiautomated data extraction from clinic letters into a database can be achieved successfully with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.
Résumé
Contexte
Les bases de données sur les cardiopathies congénitales (CC) sont un moyen efficace d’obtenir des ensembles de données pour réaliser des inférences statistiques. Cependant, la collecte de données était jusqu’ici une activité exigeant beaucoup de travail et de temps, et un soutien financier considérable était nécessaire pour en assurer la pérennité. Nous rapportons la création et l’essai pilote d’une technique d’extraction semi-automatique de données provenant de lettres médicales pour alimenter une base de données cliniques.
Méthodologie
Des lettres médicales en format PDF stockées dans un dossier local ont été traitées par une série d’algorithmes permettant l’extraction, le prétraitement et l’analyse de données. Des renseignements précis sur les patients (diagnostics, complexité diagnostique, interventions, arythmies, médicaments et données démographiques) ont été transformés en fichiers au format texte et en tableaux de données structurés, afin d’alimenter une base de données. Un schéma précis de validation des données a été prédéfini pour la vérification et le traitement de l’information contenue dans la base de données. Un apprentissage non supervisé, par la technique de réduction de dimensionnalité, a été utilisé pour projeter les données en deux dimensions et visualiser leur structure intrinsèque, en ce qui a trait aux diagnostics, aux médicaments, aux interventions et à la complexité de la maladie (selon la classification de la Société européenne de cardiologie). Quatre-vingt-treize lettres ont été sélectionnées aléatoirement afin de vérifier manuellement l’exactitude de la technique.
Résultats
Les lettres médicales consécutives de 1 409 patients en contexte de consultation externe ont été utilisées pour alimenter la Scottish Adult Congenital Cardiac Database. L’âge moyen des patients était de 35,4 ans; 47,6 % étaient de sexe féminin; 698 (49,5 %) présentaient des lésions de complexité modérée, 369 (26,1 %) présentaient des lésions de complexité élevée et 284 (20,1 %) présentaient des lésions de complexité légère. L’extraction des diagnostics individuels a été réussie dans 96,95 % des lettres, et les données démographiques ont été extraites dans 100 % d’entre elles. L’extraction des données, le téléversement dans la base de données, l’analyse des données et la visualisation ont été effectués en 571 secondes (9,51 minutes). L’extraction manuelle des données pour les catégories des diagnostics, des interventions et des médicaments a confirmé l’exactitude de l’algorithme informatique dans une proportion de 94 %, de 93 % et de 93 %, respectivement.
Conclusions
Une extraction semi-automatique des données de lettres médicales pour alimenter une base de données est possible avec une exactitude et une efficacité élevées.}
